**CodTech IT Solutions Internship- Number Guessing Game Documentation**

**Internship Project Overview:**

- **Company Name**: CodTech IT Solutions
- **Intern's Name**: N.lavanya
- **Project Title**: Number Guessing Game# Number-guessing-game

**Introduction:**
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for the Number Guessing Game developed during the Java internship at CODTECH IT Solutions by N. Lavanya. The game is designed to enhance understanding and implementation skills in Java programming, particularly focusing on concepts like loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.

**1. Project Overview:**
The Number Guessing Game is a simple Java program where the computer generates a random number, and the player needs to guess that number within a limited number of attempts. It offers an interactive experience, prompting the player with hints to guide them towards the correct guess.

**2. Features:**
   - Random number generation.
   - User input for guessing.
   - Feedback messages based on the user's input.
   - Limited number of attempts.
   - Option to replay the game.

**3. Technologies Used:**
   - Java programming language.
   - Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for coding.
   - Git for version control (optional).

**4. Implementation:**
   - **Random Number Generation:**
     The `java.util.Random` class is used to generate a random number within a specified range. This random number serves as the target for the player to guess.

   - **User Input Handling:**
     The `Scanner` class is employed to take input from the user. The input is then parsed and validated to ensure it's within the acceptable range of guesses.

   - **Game Logic:**
     The core logic involves comparing the user's guess with the randomly generated number. Based on this comparison, appropriate feedback is provided to the user (e.g., "Too high", "Too low", or "Correct guess!").

   - **Looping and Iteration:**
     The game utilizes loops to allow the player multiple attempts until either they guess the correct number or exhaust their attempts.

   - **Replay Option:**
     Upon completion of the game, the player is prompted if they want to play again. This feature utilizes conditional statements to handle user choices.



**5. Conclusion:**
Developing the Number Guessing Game in Java has provided valuable insights into core programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and user input handling. This project has not only enhanced practical coding skills but also fostered a deeper understanding of Java development methodologies. Moving forward, the knowledge gained from this internship project will serve as a solid foundation for tackling more complex Java applications.

This documentation encapsulates the process and implementation details of the Number Guessing Game developed as part of the Java internship at CODTECH IT Solutions by N. Lavanya. Through this project, practical experience and proficiency in Java programming have been significantly augmented, laying the groundwork for future endeavors in software development.
